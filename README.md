## Energy Efficient Clustering in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) using Genetic Algorithm ##

# Overview #
This project aims to determine the optimal number of clusters within a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) with the core objective of minimizing energy consumption within the infrastructure, thereby enhancing its longevity.

# Algorithm #
The project utilizes a Genetic Algorithm to find the optimal number of clusters within the WSN. Genetic Algorithms are heuristic search algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics.

# Dependencies #
The project requires the matplotlib library for visualization. Ensure it is installed in your Python environment before running the code.

# Usage #
To run the project, execute the GeneticAlgo.py script using Python.

# Command #
python GeneticAlgo.py
